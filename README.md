# DAA-Longest-Palindrome-Project
DAA Mini Project | Comparison of Dynamic Programming and Manacher’s Algorithm to detect the longest palindrome word in a string. Built during the 4th semester at SRM Institute of Science and Technology.

# 🔁 Longest Palindrome Detection — DAA Mini Project

This project focuses on detecting the longest palindromic word from a given string using two approaches:
- Dynamic Programming
- Manacher’s Algorithm

Done as part of the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course at SRM IST during the 4th semester (2023).

## 📌 Project Summary
Two algorithms are used to solve the same problem and compared in terms of logic and efficiency.
